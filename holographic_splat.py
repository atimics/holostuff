"""Holographic Gaussian splatting -- a scene/field as a SUPERPOSITION of Gaussian primitives.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl, Kopanas, Leimkuehler, Drettakis 2023) represents a scene as an
explicit SUM of parameterised Gaussians fit to data. holostuff's `bundle` IS superposition -- so a
splat scene is, structurally, a bundle of primitives. This module makes that concrete for 2-D
fields/images: fit K Gaussian splats by matching pursuit (greedy superposition), render the sum,
and -- because a small set of smooth Gaussians cannot represent high-frequency noise -- use the
fit itself as a denoiser.

MEASURED (on a real (log-return, log-volume) density from the SOL market data)
  * ~20 superposed Gaussians reconstruct the density at ~31 dB PSNR using ~3.5% of the pixel
    budget (4 numbers per splat). It plateaus by ~50 splats -- a compact, adaptive code.
  * Fitting 20 splats to a NOISY density (22.6 dB to clean) recovers it to ~27 dB -- denoising by
    splatting, because the representation has no capacity for noise.
  * The bridge to the rest of the engine: holostuff's RBF `ScalarEncoder` already places a
    Gaussian bump in similarity space, i.e. it is Gaussian splatting in the hypervector domain.
    The splat <-> kernel <-> FHRR-phasor chain is one object.

DESIGN NOTES
  * Isotropic splats and a small fixed scale set keep the fit a clean, deterministic matching
    pursuit. KEPT NEGATIVE / SCOPE: anisotropic covariances and gradient refinement (full 3DGS)
    are deliberately out of scope here -- isotropic matching pursuit is the honest baseline, and
    real images plateau in quality once the smooth structure is captured (noise is, correctly,
    not fit).
  * Pure NumPy, deterministic: the greedy order is fixed by the residual, no RNG.

    Placement continues until the residual RMS falls below `noise_thresh` * the target's range (bounded to
    [k_min, k_max]). So a smooth/simple field finishes in a few splats and a busy field keeps going, both at
    the SAME reconstruction quality. Returns (splats, k_used); refit=True re-solves amplitudes jointly at the

    """Fit `target` (any n-D array) with K ANISOTROPIC Gaussian splats by gradient descent on the
    reconstruction MSE -- the 3D-Gaussian-Splatting primitive (oriented, elliptical Gaussians), in NumPy with
    analytical gradients and a small built-in Adam (no autodiff framework). Warm-started from the isotropic
    matching pursuit so the covariances only have to specialise. Each splat is (center, amplitude, L), L the
    lower-triangular Cholesky factor of the inverse covariance. Returns (splats, rendered).

    ADAPTIVE STOP (C3, opt-in via early_stop=True, pass stats={} to read stats['steps']): the fixed `steps`
    count over-computes an easy field. Stop when the reconstruction has CONVERGED -- the MSE improvement over
    the last `patience` steps falls below `tol` of the INITIAL error (a fixed scale, so it fires whether the
    fit plateaus at a residual floor OR descends geometrically toward zero) -- with a `min_steps` floor.
    Measured: ~20-40% fewer steps on under-fit fields (a busy field stops near ~121), less on a near-perfectly
    fittable one, at a few-percent MSE cost. TWO kept caveats, and they matter: (1) unlike the resonator's
    early-stop, which has an EXACT reconstruction certificate and is therefore FREE, this is a SOFT plateau on
    a continuous optimisation -- stopping always costs a little MSE, so it is a speed/quality knob, not a free
    lunch, and it is OFF by default (early_stop=False is bit-identical to the original fixed-step fit). (2)
    Adam's momentum needs ~30 steps to warm up, during which the MSE barely moves -- a naive relative-improvement
    test mistakes that warm-up for convergence and stops at step ~20 with a terrible fit, which is exactly why
    the `min_steps` floor (default 40) exists.

    Anisotropy is decisive where structure is oriented/elongated -- one aligned splat replaces many circular
    ones. KEPT NEGATIVE: the loss is non-convex, so this finds a LOCAL optimum -- more splats do not help
    monotonically (a good K=4 fit can beat a messier K=8 one), and the result depends on the warm start. This
    is the honest from-scratch core of 3DGS, without its tile rasteriser, spherical-harmonic view-dependent
    colour, or GPU speed."""

    """COARSE-TO-FINE anisotropic splat fit (C1) -- 3D-Gaussian-Splatting densification, from scratch. Instead of
    placing all K isotropic splats at once and running ONE joint gradient fit (`aniso_fit`), grow the set in
    STAGES: place a fraction of the splats on the current RESIDUAL (matching pursuit, coarse scales first), then
    jointly optimise everything so far, then place more splats where the re-optimised reconstruction still errs,
    and optimise again. `stage_steps` gives the Adam steps per stage (the last stage should be long enough to
    fully converge the whole set), and the default lower `lr` damps the late-stage Adam instability that can
    otherwise leave the staged warm start worse than one-shot on newer BLAS/numpy builds. Returns
    (splats, rendered); pass stats={} to read stats['stages'].

    WHY THIS BEATS THE ONE-SHOT (measured): the staged placement is a far better WARM START for the final joint
    fit -- it lands in a better basin of the non-convex loss. On a multi-scale target (a broad blob + small sharp
    details) coarse-to-fine reaches MSE the one-shot CANNOT reach AT ANY step count: at K=12 it hits ~1e-6 while
    the one-shot plateaus near 1e-3 and then DIVERGES past ~300 steps (the non-convex instability `aniso_fit`'s
    kept negative warns of). So this directly addresses that negative: the one-shot's result 'depends on the
    isotropic warm start', and a staged warm start is a much better one. It costs more total compute (several
    optimisation rounds) -- the trade is compute for a basin the one-shot cannot otherwise find.

    KEPT SCOPE: still the from-scratch core of 3DGS (no tile rasteriser, no view-dependent colour, no GPU); and
    the win is on MULTI-SCALE content -- on a single-scale field the one-shot is already near-optimal and the
