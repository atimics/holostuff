"""unifiers.py -- the registry of leCore's UNIFIERS and their named clients, and whether each one is actually wired.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the systemic finding)
--------------------------------------
The engine's biggest structural debt is not missing capability -- it is capability that EXISTS, is excellent, and is
wired to none of its own named clients. `holographic_iterate`'s docstring says outright that subdivision, the
propagator's k-step rollout, the diffusion steady state and the resonator's fixed points are all "iterate a linear
operator"... and it was wired to 0 of the 7 modules it names, each of which hand-rolls the loop. That is a silo with
a signpost pointing at it.

A unifier wired at ONE call site is still a silo. So this file makes the claim checkable:

  * `REGISTRY` names each unifier, the module it lives in, the symbols that count as "citing" it, and the clients its
    own docstring/design says should use it.
  * `status()` reads the live code (plain text search -- no imports, no side effects) and reports wired / not wired.
  * `tests/test_unifier_adoption.py` turns that into a CI lint: a wired client may never silently un-wire, and the
    list of pending ones may only ever shrink.
  * `python tools/unifiers.py` prints the table; `--markdown` emits the UNIFIERS.md registry.

Adding a unifier here is how you make "promote and generalize" stick: the moment someone hand-rolls the thing again,
the lint tells them where the canonical home is.

    # is a transport backend), and `physics`/`emitter` for sleep and CCD (neither has an island or a collider).
    # Reading each one is what found that; no scan could have.
"""
# EMPTY AGAIN, and this time because four clients were MEASURED AND RETIRED rather than because none was registered.
#
# `coarsefirst` was DARK -- a general primitive with no door. It now has a mind faculty, and exactly one engine
# client: `adaptive_sample.converged_mask`, whose complement IS an escalate mask. That adoption is about owning a
# CONTRACT (what "above the cutoff" means, and what happens on a tie), not about speed -- proven bit-identical on
# 100,000 variances including exact ties, because the tie convention is the opposite of coarse-first's default.
#
# The other four named clients are all in NOT_APPLICABLE with measurements, for ONE reason:
#     COARSE-FIRST BUYS ADAPTIVITY FOR A METHOD THAT HAS NONE.
#   * `splat`   -- greedy placement is already adaptive; cost is per primitive, not per cell.
#   * `volint`  -- the line integral is closed form; there are no cells to escalate.
#   * `render`  -- `empty_skip` + `early_term` ARE coarse-first, buying 15.2x where a residual mask buys 1.0x.
#   * `nystrom` -- the gate PASSES and the method still loses: max residual is the most isolated point, and a
#                  spectral embedding needs a MASS signal, not a COVERAGE one.
#
# `gbuffer.converge_samples` was recorded here for a long time and was the wrong module: it does not build the
# mask, it calls `converged_mask`. Reading the code found the right one.
#
# NOTE THE SHAPE OF THIS RESULT. A unifier invented AFTER its clients may find that every one of them already
# solved the problem, differently and better. That is not a wiring debt to be paid down; it is a discovery about
# where the primitive belongs -- and it is only reachable by measuring, because a registry full of plausible
# PENDING lines looks exactly like work worth doing.
# EMPTY, as of the `meshsubdiv` close-out. Every registered unifier is now cited by every named client it has, or
# that client sits in NOT_APPLICABLE with a measured reason. The entry that lived here longest read:
#
#     ("iterate.step_k / limit", "holographic_meshsubdiv")  --  "an irregular 2-D mesh around an extraordinary
#     vertex is not shift-invariant: Stam's method diagonalises the LOCAL subdivision matrix there instead. A
#     build, not a wall."
#
# It was a build, and smaller than it looked, because the part of the local Loop operator that is NOT shift-
# invariant is only the centre vertex. The ring-to-ring block is exactly the circulant of [3/8, 1/8, ..., 1/8] --
# a bind operator -- so `iterate.transfer` diagonalises it for free, and `meshsubdiv.loop_limit` now cites it to
# evaluate the k -> infinity limit surface in closed form. What remains unbuilt is FINITE k on an irregular mesh
# (the full Stam evaluation), which is a different construction and is recorded in loop_limit's honest scope.
# Progress is recorded by deletion from this set (the lint forces it). If a new unifier is
# registered with clients that do not yet cite it, list them here so the lint tracks the gap.


# THE ORIGINAL SCOPE -- every client each unifier's design/docstring ever named. This exists so the lint cannot be
# made green by NARROWING the registry: each of these must end up either (a) a wired client, or (b) an entry in
# NOT_APPLICABLE with a measured reason. Deleting a hard client is not progress; retiring it with evidence is.
