holographic_encoders.py
========================

Front-ends that turn raw data into meaningful vectors for the holographic
engine in holographic_ai.py. This is the piece that lets the same brain handle
numbers, text, and mixed records -- you swap the encoder, not the engine.

An encoder is a PLACEMENT RULE: it decides where each input lands in the vector
space. Two situations that should be treated alike must land near each other,
or none of the downstream similarity/memory machinery works. There are three
ways to get a good placement rule, and this file has one example of each:

  * Built in by hand   -> the creature's egocentric features (holographic_creature.py)
  * Built in by math   -> ScalarEncoder below: fractional power encoding makes
                          nearby NUMBERS automatically land near each other.
  * Learned from data  -> TextEncoder below: random indexing learns word meaning
                          from co-occurrence, with no gradient descent at all.

RecordEncoder then binds several fields (numeric + categorical + text) into a
single vector, so one record of mixed types is one point in the space.

Needs: numpy, and holographic_ai.py beside it.
