"""Part 03 of UnifiedMind's faculty surface -- 115 methods, build_predictor .. denoise.

NOT A STANDALONE MODULE. This is one slice of the single `UnifiedMind` class, which grew to 17.4k lines
in one file and went past the 1 MB cap an agent can read in a single pass -- so the engine could no
longer read its own central nervous system. The class is assembled from these parts by
holographic/misc/holographic_unified.py, which is still the only import path anyone uses.

Every method here is a real attribute of UnifiedMind at runtime (mixin, not delegation), so `mind.x()`,
`dir(mind)`, the doc generators and the service's tool introspection all behave exactly as before. The
bodies were moved by line range, not regenerated, so they are byte-identical to the originals.

KEPT NEGATIVE, so nobody "tidies" it: these part classes are NOT a public API and must never be
imported or subclassed directly. They carry no `__init__` and assume the state UnifiedMind.__init__
builds; instantiated alone they would fail on the first attribute access. The leading underscore on
the class name says so, and the reachability audit reads them as referenced-by-unified, not as
standalone capabilities.

        break_even_n=1.63 a request repeating even twice pays for it.
        THE HARD RULE IS ENFORCED IN CODE, NOT DOCUMENTED: a resolution whose exactness is NONDETERMINISTIC
        is NEVER stored -- caching a model's answer is a bug, not a slowdown, because it is a fact about one
        moment rather than a value you can key on. Rungs 0-3 never produce one, which is exactly why the

        distribution (median, p05, min) at full precision, because a rate without margins says what happened
        and not why.
        WHY IT EXISTS: no published paper measures top-1 flip rate under quantization at 500-2,000 items --
        the retrieval literature reports recall@k and nDCG@10 at 100K-1M scale, where a few flips vanish
        into a rank metric. MEASURED here on the shipped 509x128 index: exact-row and even +60%-noise
        queries flip 0.00% (margins ~0.53-0.58), while queries sitting MIDWAY BETWEEN TWO DOCUMENTS collapse
        to margin ~0.058 and flip ~1%. By bit width on those ambiguous queries: 8b 1.3%, 5b 5.7%, 3b 22.3%,
        2b 37.3% -- while normal queries stay 0.00% at EVERY width down to 2 bits.
        THE FINDING: FLIP RATE IS GOVERNED BY MARGIN, NOT BY CORPUS SIZE OR BIT WIDTH. So decision-safety is
        not answerable from N and bits; it needs the margin distribution of the queries you actually serve.
        KEPT NEGATIVE: a uint8-vs-float8 verdict CANNOT be taken on the shipped index, which is already
        uint8 -- uniform re-quantization there is a no-op (max|err| 0.000000) while float8 genuinely
        re-quantizes, so the comparison would measure the source grid, not the quantizers."""

          method='adaptive' : project onto a low-rank SVD subspace fit from `samples`, then
                              noise-THRESHOLD the coefficients (Donoho-Johnstone). The safe default for
                              low-rank signals -- estimates the noise level itself, so it does not
                              over-smooth at low noise.
          method='manifold' : plain FIXED-rank projection onto the subspace fit from `samples`.
          method='codebook' : modern-Hopfield cleanup of `x` toward a discrete `codebook` manifold.
          method='nlm'       : non-local means -- `x` is a (N, dim) patch set; average each patch with
                              its near-duplicates via the engine's own content-addressable recall.
          method='trajectory': clean a LONE 1-D signal with no external prior -- its sliding-window Hankel
                              matrix is low-rank for a smooth/structured signal (SSA/Cadzow), so project the
                              windows onto their own subspace and reconstruct. The second prior-free method
                              beside nlm (nlm needs a patch SET; this takes a raw 1-D signal).
          method='spectral' : clean a lone scalar FIELD living on a known manifold GEOMETRY -- pass the point
                              coordinates as points=<(N, d)> and x as the field value at each of those N points.
                              Builds the kNN graph-Laplacian eigenbasis (EXP-5/6) and projects the field onto
                              its low-frequency modes. The NONLINEAR-manifold map the linear methods lack: it is
                              the only denoiser here that needs no example set and no codebook, just the cloud's
                              own geometry. Measured on a smooth field over a 2-sphere, it cleans error 4.1->0.9
                              where the geometry-blind options barely move it (trajectory 3.1, DCT 4.2) -- a
                              linear/1-D prior cannot see a curved manifold's smoothness.
          method='pnp'       : Plug-and-Play / RED restoration of a degraded measurement x = forward(clean)
                              + noise, using the adaptive manifold map as the prior (needs forward/adjoint).
          method='auto'      : codebook if a `codebook` is given, else adaptive manifold if `samples`
                              are given. NLM and PnP stay OPT-IN: deciding self-similar-vs-low-rank
                              automatically is itself a measurement we will not fake -- name them.
          method='geometry'  : route by the GEOMETRY of the set you hand (samples= or codebook=). Read its
                              effective rank; if LOW relative to the row count (a continuous manifold)
                              project onto that subspace; if HIGH (distinct atoms) do codebook recall. This
                              is the measured 'match the map to the manifold' rule -- projection is
                              near-perfect on a low-rank manifold and FAILS (67% recall) on high-rank atoms,
                              so the rank knee picks the right one.

        `readout='sparsemax'` switches the codebook/recall branches from the softmax blend (which
        over-smooths a continuous manifold) to the sparse Hopfield-Fenchel-Young readout; the default
        'softmax' leaves every path bit-for-bit unchanged.

        `check_manifold=True` (method='spectral' only) first verifies the points form a single connected manifold
        via is_manifold and raises if they do not -- the spectral map's premise -- rather than silently returning
        graph low-pass on a blob. Default False keeps the path overhead-free and backward-compatible.

        A denoiser needs a PRIOR; a single vector with no manifold cannot be cleaned (no free lunch), so
        `samples` (clean rows) or `codebook` (atoms) is required for every method but 'nlm' (which uses
        `x`'s own redundancy). Returns the cleaned vector (or, for 'nlm', the cleaned (N, dim) set).

        KEPT NEGATIVES (the modules', surfaced not hidden): FIXED-rank projection over-smooths at low
        noise -- use 'adaptive', which is ~neutral there; manifold projection only helps where real
        low-rank structure exists (it destroys structureless signal); NLM only helps where near-duplicates
        exist."""
