"""Part 08 of UnifiedMind's faculty surface -- 134 methods, bake .. sparse_reconstruct.

NOT A STANDALONE MODULE. This is one slice of the single `UnifiedMind` class, which grew to 17.4k lines
in one file and went past the 1 MB cap an agent can read in a single pass -- so the engine could no
longer read its own central nervous system. The class is assembled from these parts by
holographic/misc/holographic_unified.py, which is still the only import path anyone uses.

Every method here is a real attribute of UnifiedMind at runtime (mixin, not delegation), so `mind.x()`,
`dir(mind)`, the doc generators and the service's tool introspection all behave exactly as before. The
bodies were moved by line range, not regenerated, so they are byte-identical to the originals.

KEPT NEGATIVE, so nobody "tidies" it: these part classes are NOT a public API and must never be
imported or subclassed directly. They carry no `__init__` and assume the state UnifiedMind.__init__
builds; instantiated alone they would fail on the first attribute access. The leading underscore on
the class name says so, and the reachability audit reads them as referenced-by-unified, not as
standalone capabilities.

        WHY IT IS NEEDED, AND WHY THE OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVE IS NOT COMING: the shipped artifact is the
        DOCUMENT side only (509 modules x 128d), so free text routes to an honest None. The natural fix --
        distil the encoder into a token table plus one ridge matrix W (tools/semantic/distill_map.py) and
        ship that as the query side -- WAS TRIED, MEASURED ON THE REAL CORPUS, AND REFUSED. At the shipped
        128d:
            [floor] SIF token-pool, NO learned map    top-1 3/12   median 13
            [ours]  SIF @ W, the distilled map        top-1 1/12   median 19
        The learned map is WORSE THAN NOT HAVING ONE: ridge explained R^2 +0.06 of held-out variance and
        cost 2 top-1 and 6 median rank to apply. distill_map's export gate (EXPORT_BAR_TOP1=4,
        EXPORT_BAR_MEDIAN=8) refuses it, and tests/test_queryembed_artifact.py pins BOTH halves -- the gate
        and the absence of any committed artifact. So this seam is not a stopgap while the distilled path
        matures; IT IS THE ROUTE. Do not re-propose shipping a distilled query artifact without new numbers
        that beat the floor.

        VERIFICATION IS ON BY DEFAULT, and this is the point of the seam rather than a bare setter. The index
        lives in ONE embedding space (nomic, ABTT-corrected). A cosine between a query embedded by a
        DIFFERENT model and a nomic document is not a weak signal, it is a MEANINGLESS one -- and it still
        returns five ranked names with confident-looking scores. Dimension is checkable and is checked;
        SPACE IS NOT, so verify=True runs a round-trip probe: sample modules that are in the index, embed
        each one's OWN docstring summary, and require it to self-recall at top-k. Chance is 5/509 = 0.0098,
        so the default 0.30 bar is ~30x chance -- loose on purpose, because the job is separating "right
        space" from "unrelated space", not grading embedding quality.

        Raises ValueError with the measured rate and the misses when the probe fails. Pass verify=False to
        install unchecked (documented, not recommended). Returns the probe dict on success, None when
