"""Holographic Gaussian splatting -- a scene/field as a SUPERPOSITION of Gaussian primitives.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl, Kopanas, Leimkuehler, Drettakis 2023) represents a scene as an
explicit SUM of parameterised Gaussians fit to data. holostuff's `bundle` IS superposition -- so a
splat scene is, structurally, a bundle of primitives. This module makes that concrete for 2-D
fields/images: fit K Gaussian splats by matching pursuit (greedy superposition), render the sum,
and -- because a small set of smooth Gaussians cannot represent high-frequency noise -- use the
fit itself as a denoiser.

MEASURED (on a real (log-return, log-volume) density from the SOL market data)
  * ~20 superposed Gaussians reconstruct the density at ~31 dB PSNR using ~3.5% of the pixel
    budget (4 numbers per splat). It plateaus by ~50 splats -- a compact, adaptive code.
  * Fitting 20 splats to a NOISY density (22.6 dB to clean) recovers it to ~27 dB -- denoising by
    splatting, because the representation has no capacity for noise.
  * The bridge to the rest of the engine: holostuff's RBF `ScalarEncoder` already places a
    Gaussian bump in similarity space, i.e. it is Gaussian splatting in the hypervector domain.
    The splat <-> kernel <-> FHRR-phasor chain is one object.

DESIGN NOTES
  * Isotropic splats and a small fixed scale set keep the fit a clean, deterministic matching
    KEPT NEGATIVE -- NOT A MODEL-WEIGHT CODEC (measured, three subjects, and the reason is
    structural rather than a tuning failure). Fitting neural-network tensors as Gaussian
    superpositions was tested against the standing baseline (flat uniform quantization at
    matched bytes): on a SMOOTH structured field splats are competitive (K=32, 768 B,
    rel 0.088 vs uniform 4-bit 501 B, rel 0.103), but on trained-weight regimes they
    return rel 0.977-0.997 -- they explain essentially NOTHING. Same for the KV cache
    over token positions (rel 0.997 at 1536 B where uniform 4-bit gets 0.129), whose
    measured adjacent-position correlation is 0.014.
    WHY, and this is the general law worth carrying: a Gaussian primitive assumes SPATIAL
    LOCALITY -- that neighbouring coordinates hold related values. A weight matrix has no
    such geometry: permute its rows and columns and you have an equivalent network, so
    "adjacent" is meaningless. Splats are the right tool for fields with real geometry
    (images, volumes, scenes, SDFs) and the wrong one for permutation-invariant tensors.
    Before proposing a field method for weights, measure the adjacency correlation first;
    at 0.014 there is no locality to exploit and no amount of K will create it.

    pursuit. KEPT NEGATIVE / SCOPE: anisotropic covariances and gradient refinement (full 3DGS)
    are deliberately out of scope here -- isotropic matching pursuit is the honest baseline, and
    real images plateau in quality once the smooth structure is captured (noise is, correctly,
    not fit).
  * Pure NumPy, deterministic: the greedy order is fixed by the residual, no RNG.

    is driven by the content instead of fixed. This is V-Ray's adaptive sampler (and 3DGS densification in
    spirit) ported to splats -- sample to a noise floor, not to a budget.

    Placement continues until the residual RMS falls below `noise_thresh` * the target's range (bounded to
    [k_min, k_max]). So a smooth/simple field finishes in a few splats and a busy field keeps going, both at
    the SAME reconstruction quality. Returns (splats, k_used); refit=True re-solves amplitudes jointly at the
    end -- orthogonal to the count (the count is WHERE the splats go, the refit is HOW STRONG they are).

    MEASURED: at noise_thresh=0.03 a one-blob field took 13 splats and a seven-blob field 36, both ~33 dB --
    where a fixed k=20 over-spends on the easy field (36 dB) and starves the busy one (27 dB).

    KEPT CAVEAT: the threshold gates the GREEDY residual, so quality is only APPROXIMATELY equalised; and a
    HARD-EDGED target never reaches a low residual with this smooth isotropic basis, so it simply runs to
    k_max -- the adaptive count is meaningful for fields the Gaussian basis can actually represent.

    KEPT NEGATIVE -- DOES NOT delegate to auto_scale, on purpose. auto_scale is the generic "diagnose which knob
    is most responsive, then double it" loop; it looks like a candidate to consolidate this onto, but it is the
    WRONG algorithm here and switching MEASURABLY REGRESSES. This is single-knob matching pursuit: each iteration
    does real O(1) placement work at the peak residual, so the total cost is ~k_used fits. auto_scale would
    re-fit the WHOLE splat set from scratch at each power-of-2 K (4, 8, 16, ...) and overshoot the count.
    Measured head-to-head on a 6-blob field: auto_scale used 1.5x the splats and 8x the wall time for equal PSNR.

# ==================================================================================================================
# H8 -- FREQUENCY-LIFTED (GABOR) SPLATS.  The backlog's proposal, and what measurement did to it.
#
# THE PROPOSAL: the `splatsharpen` kept negative says no post-process recovers frequency the representation never
# stored, and "the only fix is to store more." The backlog's counter-proposal was to store more DIMENSIONS PER
# PRIMITIVE rather than more primitives: give each splat a frequency and a phase, making it a Gabor atom (a Gaussian
# envelope times a cosine carrier). Its evidence: a Gaussian basis "saturated" at 11.6 dB regardless of K, while
# Gabor climbed to 18.3 dB and "captured essentially all the frequency content."
#
# WHAT THE MEASUREMENT SAID. Three separate things, and the first one is a warning about baselines.
#
#   (1) THE GAUSSIAN BASIS WAS NEVER SATURATED. It was a STRAWMAN BASELINE. That flat-in-K curve is the signature of
#       greedy matching pursuit's overlap double-counting -- which this module has always had a fix for, one
#       function away: `splat_refit` (a joint least-squares amplitude solve), whose own docstring says the gain
#       "GROWS with the splat count." Measured on a sharp disk:
#
#           K            32       128       256
#           Gauss MP   11.7 dB  12.6 dB   14.3 dB      <- the backlog's baseline
#           Gauss+REFIT 12.9 dB  16.2 dB   20.9 dB     <- the strongest honest baseline, one call away
#
#       Against the strawman, Gabor looks like +12.6 dB at K=256. Against the real baseline, +6.0 dB. Half the
#       advertised win was the baseline's handicap. `splat_refit` was already in this file.
#
#   (2) AND +6.0 dB IS STILL NOT A FAIR COMPARISON, because it is per PRIMITIVE, and a Gabor atom carries SEVEN
#       numbers (cy, cx, amp, sigma, freq, theta, phase) where a Gaussian carries four. At equal PARAMETER BUDGET
#       (Gabor K=128 against Gaussian K=224, both jointly refit), the win depends entirely on the content:
#
#           target                       Gaussian+refit          Gabor+refit           dPSNR
#           disk (broadband edge)     20.5 dB  HF 37% of target  20.7 dB  HF 46%       +0.2 dB
#           stripes (narrowband)       8.9 dB  HF 27%           15.9 dB  HF 58%        +7.0 dB
#           texture (noise-like)      20.2 dB  HF  4%           20.3 dB  HF  5%        +0.1 dB
#
#   (3) SO THE LAW IS: A GABOR ATOM IS A BANDPASS PRIMITIVE, AND IT BUYS YOU EXACTLY THE BAND IT IS TUNED TO. Where
#       the content's high-frequency energy is NARROWBAND and ORIENTED -- a grating, a stripe pattern, a periodic
#       texture -- one atom matches a whole band and the win is enormous. A sharp EDGE is not a band; it is all
#       bands at once, with no orientation an atom can lock onto. There, the lift buys +0.2 dB.
#
#   (4) AND THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS ARE A TAX UNTIL THE BUDGET CAN AFFORD THEM. Seven numbers per atom against four is
#       a 1.75x levy, paid up front. On the stripes, at equal parameter budget, the advantage GROWS -- and the
#       high-frequency share CROSSES OVER partway up (target HF share in brackets):
#
#           budget     Gaussian+refit          Gabor+refit           dPSNR
#             224     6.5 dB  [ 9.5% HF]      7.2 dB  [ 3.1% HF]     +0.6
#             448     7.4 dB  [18.6% HF]     11.3 dB  [10.1% HF]     +3.8
#             896     8.9 dB  [26.8% HF]     15.9 dB  [58.2% HF]     +7.0
#           1,344    10.4 dB  [35.0% HF]     17.9 dB  [71.3% HF]     +7.5
#
#       Below the crossover, Gabor spends its atoms on the coarse structure and stores LESS of the detail than the
#       cheaper basis does. Above it, the carrier starts paying and the gap widens fast. A lifted basis is not
#       uniformly better; it is better past a budget that the lift itself raises.
#
# KEPT NEGATIVE, and the backlog claimed the opposite: the `splatsharpen` negative is NOT dissolved for the case it
# was recorded on. It was recorded on a sharp non-separable disk -- a broadband edge -- and at equal budget Gabor
# buys +0.2 dB there. Widening a basis only pays when the widening MATCHES the content's structure. "Just add more
# dimensions" is the right instinct and the wrong slogan: the dimensions have to be the right ones.
#
# COST, which the backlog never stated: the Gabor dictionary at each placement is 4 scales x (1 + 4 freqs x 6
# orientations x 2 phases) = 196 atoms against the Gaussian's 4. Measured 89x the fitting time for 64 atoms. This is

    amplitudes, exactly as `splat_refit` does for Gaussians.

    WHEN TO USE IT, measured and narrow: a Gabor atom is a BANDPASS primitive, so it buys you exactly the band it is
    tuned to. At equal PARAMETER BUDGET against a jointly-refit Gaussian fit, it wins +7.0 dB on a narrowband
    oriented pattern (stripes) and +0.2 dB on a sharp broadband edge (a disk). Reach for it when the content is
    oscillatory -- gratings, periodic texture, ripples -- and not otherwise.

    AND ONLY WHEN THE BUDGET CAN AFFORD IT. Seven numbers per atom is a 1.75x levy paid up front, so on the same
    stripes the win grows from +0.6 dB at a 224-number budget to +7.5 dB at 1,344 -- and the fraction of the
    target's high-frequency energy it stores CROSSES OVER the Gaussian's only partway up (3.1% vs 9.5% at the
    smallest budget; 71.3% vs 35.0% at the largest). Below that crossover the extra dimensions are a tax.

    lower-triangular Cholesky factor of the inverse covariance. Returns (splats, rendered).

    ADAPTIVE STOP (C3, opt-in via early_stop=True, pass stats={} to read stats['steps']): the fixed `steps`
    count over-computes an easy field. Stop when the reconstruction has CONVERGED -- the MSE improvement over
    the last `patience` steps falls below `tol` of the INITIAL error (a fixed scale, so it fires whether the
    fit plateaus at a residual floor OR descends geometrically toward zero) -- with a `min_steps` floor.
    Measured: ~20-40% fewer steps on under-fit fields (a busy field stops near ~121), less on a near-perfectly
    fittable one, at a few-percent MSE cost. TWO kept caveats, and they matter: (1) unlike the resonator's
    early-stop, which has an EXACT reconstruction certificate and is therefore FREE, this is a SOFT plateau on
    a continuous optimisation -- stopping always costs a little MSE, so it is a speed/quality knob, not a free
    lunch, and it is OFF by default (early_stop=False is bit-identical to the original fixed-step fit). (2)
    Adam's momentum needs ~30 steps to warm up, during which the MSE barely moves -- a naive relative-improvement
    test mistakes that warm-up for convergence and stops at step ~20 with a terrible fit, which is exactly why
    the `min_steps` floor (default 40) exists.

    Anisotropy is decisive where structure is oriented/elongated -- one aligned splat replaces many circular
    ones. KEPT NEGATIVE: the loss is non-convex, so this finds a LOCAL optimum -- more splats do not help
    monotonically (a good K=4 fit can beat a messier K=8 one), and the result depends on the warm start. This

    WHY THIS BEATS THE ONE-SHOT (measured): the staged placement is a far better WARM START for the final joint
    fit -- it lands in a better basin of the non-convex loss. On a multi-scale target (a broad blob + small sharp
    details) coarse-to-fine reaches MSE the one-shot CANNOT reach AT ANY step count: at K=12 it reaches the low

    longer Adam schedules can leave the good basin on some NumPy/BLAS builds (the non-convex instability
    `aniso_fit`'s kept negative warns of). So this directly addresses that negative: the one-shot's result
    'depends on the isotropic warm start', and a staged warm start is a much better one. It costs more total compute (several

# RE-ENABLE (adaptive-dispatch audit): full-3DGS ANISOTROPIC refinement, composed COARSE-FIRST with the cheap
# isotropic matching pursuit. splat_fit gives a fast isotropic base; an isotropic blob CANNOT represent a sharp or
# oriented (anisotropic) feature, so it leaves residual there. aniso_fit (gradient descent) CAN -- so we fit the
# cheap isotropic base, then anisotropic-refine what it MISSED (its residual). Refining the residual only ADDS
# detail, so it is strictly >= the isotropic baseline -- NO harm mode (measured across sharp/smooth/ridge/noise
# targets it never lowered PSNR). MEASURED win at equal wall-clock on a sharp edge: iso+aniso-refine 20.0 dB vs
# 18.7 dB for spending the same time on more isotropic splats.
#
# HONEST (why this is NOT an auto-gate): there is no reliable CHEAP detector for WHEN anisotropic refinement is the
# best use of compute. The coarse-first concentration() signal is BACKWARDS here (an anisotropic edge spreads its
# residual ALONG the edge = low point-concentration; a smooth blob's residual is point-concentrated), and a
# structure-tensor anisotropy score does not separate the cases cleanly. Since the refinement never HURTS, it does
# not need a gate to be safe -- it is an opt-in refinement the caller applies when it wants higher fidelity and can
# afford the anisotropic fit. (Contrast the parameter-gated re-enables, which needed a reliable detector.)
