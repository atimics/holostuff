"""B1 probe (cross-cutting: MIS-1 multiple-importance combination -> steered text generation). KEPT NO-OP.

THE PROPOSAL (Pharr's seat, the balance heuristic, with his precondition on record): steered_generate keeps the
candidate with the best verifier (coherence) score among the predictor's top-beam, discarding the predictor's
own ranking at the selection step. So -- the reasoning went -- combine the predictor's coupling score and the
verifier's coherence score by the balance heuristic, weighting each by its reliability, instead of letting the
verifier override.

THE MEASURED ANSWER: it is a NO-OP -- the balance-heuristic combination gives results IDENTICAL to verifier-only
selection, and the reason is structural. steered_generate already uses the predictor as the candidate GATE: it
restricts to the predictor's top-`beam` candidates before the verifier picks among them. WITHIN that beam the
coupling scores are nearly flat (they are all the most-probable continuations), so after the softmax that puts
them on a common scale, the predictor's distribution is close to uniform -- and a near-uniform factor cannot move
the argmax of the product. The verifier's preference dominates the combination, so MIS == verifier. The
predictor's information is ALREADY fully spent on gating the candidate set; re-using it as a within-beam weight
is redundant.

MEASURED (a loop-trap corpus -- a frequent 'ping pong' cycle mixed with coherent clauses): the verifier DOES
materially changes the greedy loop (the direction is BLAS-sensitive because one flipped argmax cascades), but the
balance combination matches the verifier on both fluency (valid-bigram rate) and anti-looping (distinct
ratio). No improvement, on a clean corpus or a loopy one.

THE LESSON: MIS combines two estimators OVER A COMMON CANDIDATE SET ON A COMMON DENSITY SCALE (Pharr's
precondition). Here the predictor does not estimate over the same set as the verifier -- it FILTERS to its
top-beam first -- so there is nothing left for the balance heuristic to balance. The right place for MIS would be
combining two estimators of the SAME quantity over the SAME support; a gate followed by a re-ranker is not that.

No faculty, no tour line -- the finding is the no-op.
