"""holographic_sdfemit.py -- the scene's own SDF, emitted to WGSL / C / GLSL (the brain/muscle contract, realised).

The backlog's brain/muscle claim: *"the compute shaders the three.js demos hand-write become a PROJECTION of the
authoritative Python kernel -- one source of truth, two runtimes, no drift."*

It was not realised. `holographic_sdf.SDF.to_glsl()` emitted GLSL for a tree. `holographic_emit` emitted WGSL, C and
JS -- but only from a *scalar Python function's source text*. **The two emitters never met**, so
`RealtimeSession.payload("shader")` carried whatever `kernel_src` the caller passed: a shader the caller wrote by
hand, about a scene the engine never saw. That is drift by construction, and it is the exact thing the contract
exists to prevent.

`sdf_dialect(node, dialect)` walks the SAME tree `_eval` walks and emits `map(p) -> distance` in:

    wgsl    fn map(p: vec3<f32>) -> f32        the browser's muscle
    c_f64   double map(const double p[3])      the executable twin
    c_f32   float  map(const float  p[3])      what WGSL's precision actually is
    glsl    float map(vec3 p)                  Shadertoy, and what already shipped

THE BAR IS EXECUTED, exactly as K8's was. WGSL cannot be run here -- no GPU, no browser -- so the C dialect is
compiled with `cc` and RUN against the Python `_eval` on the same random points. Measured over 200 points on a
compound tree (a scaled smooth-union of a translated sphere and a rotated box):

    dialect   max |emitted - python|
    c_f64          6.7e-16            machine epsilon -- and NOT bit-identical
    c_f32          3.3e-07            TRUE f32 arithmetic; this IS the tolerance a WGSL port is judged against

**AND THAT `c_f64` IS NOT BIT-IDENTICAL, WHERE K8's SCALAR KERNEL WAS.** The difference is real and worth naming.
K8 emitted the *same expression* the Python function evaluated, so the operations happened in the same order and the
doubles agreed exactly. Here the Python side is `numpy`: `np.linalg.norm` does not compute `sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)`
in that order -- it rescales to avoid overflow -- and `np.clip` is not `clamp`. The emitted C computes the same
FUNCTION by a different summation, so it agrees to machine epsilon and not to the bit.

**And bit-identity is TREE- AND PLATFORM-DEPENDENT, which is why `max_abs_diff` is the contract.** A bare `sphere`
has come out exactly equal on OpenBLAS and one ulp apart on Accelerate; `np.linalg.norm` and
`sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z)` are free to use different reduction trees. Add a `rotate` and a `scale` and the extra
multiplies reassociate: 6.7e-16, four ulp. *Asserting `bit_identical` would be a platform accident, not a bar.*

KEPT NEGATIVE 1 -- **`menger` is not emittable, and refusing is the feature.** It is an ITERATED domain fold: a
Python loop over `iters` with a running scale. Unrolling it into a straight-line expression would produce a
correct-but-enormous shader whose size depends on a parameter, and emitting a loop would need a dialect table for
control flow that this emitter does not have. It raises, naming the node. (`holographic_sdf`'s own `INEXACT` set
already flags twist/displace as domain warps that are not exact distances; this emitter refuses those too.)

KEPT NEGATIVE 2 -- **`scale` is not `p / s`, it is `map(p / s) * s`, and forgetting the outer factor is a shader
that renders a correct SHAPE with wrong distances.** A raymarcher would overstep and miss it. The Python `_eval`
has the factor; the emitter carries it; a test pins a scaled sphere's distance at a point far from the surface,
where the shape looks right and the distance does not.

KEPT NEGATIVE 3 -- **the `f` suffix on a C literal is load-bearing.** Unsuffixed, `0.25` is a DOUBLE, and
`float_expr * 0.25` evaluates the whole expression in double before truncating. The first version of this table
omitted it, so the `c_f32` build -- the executable stand-in for WGSL -- was not a pure-f32 twin, and the tolerance
it published (2.83e-07) was **optimistic by 15%** against the true 3.26e-07. An audit found it by noticing that
`holographic_emit`'s dialect table used `"f"` and this one did not. **Two tables for one concept will disagree, and
the disagreement will be a bug in one of them.** A test now asserts the shared dialects agree, field by field.

KEPT NEGATIVE 4 -- **an emitted shader is not a rendered image.** This validates the DISTANCE FUNCTION against the
Python one, to f32 tolerance. It does not validate WGSL's precision rules, its fast-math latitude, whether the
shader compiles, or whether the browser's raymarch loop matches the engine's. Those are the front end's tests, and
saying so is cheaper than having someone discover it in a browser.

#: Nodes the multi-dialect emitter refuses. `menger` folds the domain ITERATIVELY (its unrolled size depends on a
#: parameter); `twist`, `displace`, `bend`, and `ellipsoid` are `holographic_sdf.INEXACT` -- not exact distances,
#: so a raymarcher must shorten its steps and the shader needs a warning the emitter cannot enforce. `mirror` (an
#: exact isometry) and `repeat` (infinite tiling) ARE emittable in all four dialects. `capsule`/`cone`/
#: `octahedron` are EXACT and emit via the GLSL Shadertoy path (holographic_sdf.to_glsl); they are refused HERE
#: (the 4-dialect WGSL/C emitter) only because their branch-heavy forms (cone's caps, octahedron's face select)
#: are not yet ported to the dialect table -- a filed follow-up, not a mathematical limit. capsule is a clamp
#: away and is the first to add when the table grows a general clamp(lo,hi).
#: `fold_fractal` and `mandelbulb` were NOT on this list and had no dialect rule either -- so the
#: old set-arithmetic coverage() reported them as EMITTED and the whole table as complete, while
#: sdf_dialect raised on both. They are iterative domain folds, the same reason `menger` is refused
#: here, and they DO emit through the GLSL Shadertoy path (holographic_sdf has _mandelbulb_glsl).
#: Declared rather than quietly fixed, because an undeclared gap is what the honest coverage probe
#: exists to make impossible.

# ======================================================================================================
#
# The header of this module states the rule: TWO TABLES FOR ONE CONCEPT WILL DISAGREE, and the disagreement
# will be a bug in one of them. `sdf_dialect` (here) and `SDF.to_glsl` (holographic_sdf) both emit a map()
# for the SAME tree, and only the first one was ever executed. The existing test compares DIALECT FIELDS;
# nothing compared the two emitters' ARITHMETIC, so "they agree" was a narrative, not a measurement.
#
# WHY IT LOOKED UNTESTABLE, AND WHY THAT WAS WRONG: judging GLSL seemed to need a GL runtime this project
# does not have. But the GLSL these emitters produce is a tiny subset -- vec3, +-*/, abs/min/max/length/
# clamp/dot -- and C++ has operator overloading, so a ~30-line vec3 shim makes the SAME TEXT compile and RUN
# under g++. The bar stays EXECUTED rather than asserted, which is the standard the C dialect already set.

    THE POINT: holographic_sdf.to_glsl and sdf_dialect are two emitters for one concept, and this module's
    own header warns that two tables will disagree. This executes the OTHER one, so agreement is measured
    rather than assumed. Only the helper functions and map() are compiled -- calcNormal/mainImage need
    iResolution and are display code, not the arithmetic under test.
    Raises SdfEmitError when the shader uses GLSL the shim does not model, rather than comparing wrongly."""

#: The bar the GLSL emitter is judged against. NOT bit-identity: GLSL `float` is 32-bit BY LANGUAGE
#: DEFINITION, so a shader can never reproduce a float64 tree exactly and demanding it would be asserting a
#: wish rather than the contract. MEASURED across the node zoo: 1e-7 for plain trees (f32 return types) and
#: 3.7e-7 once a rotation lands, because to_glsl formats literals to SIX significant digits -- cos(0.7)
#: ships as 0.764842, itself 1.9e-7 off. 1e-5 sits two orders above the worst measured value and far below
#: any geometrically meaningful distance, so a REAL divergence still trips it.
