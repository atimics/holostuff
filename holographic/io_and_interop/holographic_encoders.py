holographic_encoders.py
========================

Front-ends that turn raw data into meaningful vectors for the holographic
engine in holographic_ai.py. This is the piece that lets the same brain handle
numbers, text, and mixed records -- you swap the encoder, not the engine.

An encoder is a PLACEMENT RULE: it decides where each input lands in the vector
space. Two situations that should be treated alike must land near each other,
or none of the downstream similarity/memory machinery works. There are three
ways to get a good placement rule, and this file has one example of each:

  * Built in by hand   -> the creature's egocentric features (holographic_creature.py)
  * Built in by math   -> ScalarEncoder below: fractional power encoding makes
                          nearby NUMBERS automatically land near each other.
  * Learned from data  -> TextEncoder below: random indexing learns word meaning
                          from co-occurrence, with no gradient descent at all.

RecordEncoder then binds several fields (numeric + categorical + text) into a
single vector, so one record of mixed types is one point in the space.

Needs: numpy, and holographic_ai.py beside it.

#    pick random phases once, then encoding a value x just rotates those phases

    WHY A SEPARATE CLASS: the ScalarEncoder is a LINE encoder -- its phases are arbitrary reals, so theta and
    theta + period land at different codes, and 23:59 sits maximally far from 00:01 (measured: cos 0.21 where
    the true 2-minute gap should read ~1.0). No bandwidth choice fixes that; periodicity requires the phase
    frequencies to be INTEGERS (in units of 2*pi/period), and that is a different construction, not a
    parameter. (The audited alternative -- I2's proposed 'SignedEncoder' -- was REFUTED the same way: signed
    values are native to ScalarEncoder(lo=-a, hi=a), decode recovers the sign, nothing to build.)

    Construction: harmonic numbers n_j >= 1 drawn from a geometric distribution (P(n) ~ r^n), phases
    exp(i * n_j * omega * x) with omega = 2*pi/period, conjugate-symmetric so the code is real. By Bochner on

    the POISSON KERNEL MINUS ITS DC TERM, because n=0 must be excluded for zero-mean codes. That subtraction
    is not free, and the first draft of this docstring claimed positivity anyway; measurement corrected it:
    the kernel is near-positive with a SMALL NEGATIVE ANTIPODAL DIP (k(pi) between -0.16 at r=0.70 and -0.02
    at r=0.85, pinned), the circular price of removing the constant. `concentration` r in (0,1) trades lobe
    width for that dip: r=0.70 reads k(0.1)=0.90 (wide, deeper dip), r=0.95 reads k(0.1)=0.14 (narrow,
    near-orthogonal fast). The default 0.85 is the middle of that trade.
