"""AMP-1 -- Approximate Message Passing recovery (holographic_amp).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
The FIFTH member of the engine's bundle-recovery family, recovering the components of
`cue = sum_i w_i * codebook[i]`. The others:
  * LINEAR      -- one-shot correlations, keep the top m (order-free, washes out at load);
  * OCCLUSION   -- greedy matching pursuit, one atom per step, never revisited;
  * IHT         -- projected gradient descent: gradient step then keep the K largest, iterated;
  * CoSaMP      -- batch selection with a least-squares solve each round (the strongest, so far).

AMP (Donoho, Maleki & Montanari 2009) is IHT WITH ONE EXTRA TERM, and that term is the whole idea. The
plain gradient residual `z = y - A w` carries correlations between the current estimate and the design
matrix, so the effective noise seen by the denoiser is NOT Gaussian and the threshold cannot be set from
theory. AMP adds the ONSAGER CORRECTION -- a memory term proportional to the fraction of currently active
coefficients -- which cancels exactly those correlations. With it, the residual behaves like AWGN, so the
threshold can be read off the residual norm itself (STATE EVOLUTION) instead of being a tuned constant, and
the sparsity K need not be known in advance.

WHY IT WAS BUILT HERE
  RESEARCH_CONSOLIDATED.md ranks SPARCs + AMP as the #1 transplant, on the strength of a structural
  isomorphism that is real: a SPARC design matrix has L sections of M columns with one nonzero per section,
  which is exactly L codebooks of M codewords; a VSA bundle IS a noisy SPARC codeword, and unbundling IS
  section decoding. Adjacent work (Kleyko et al., Neural Computation 2023) reports information rate rising
  0.60 -> 1.26 bits/dim from decoder changes alone.

THE MEASURED RESULT -- A CROSSOVER, NOT A WIN, AND IT REFUTED THE AUTHOR'S OWN PREDICTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Five predictions were recorded BEFORE measuring. The load-bearing one was "AMP does NOT lift the capacity
ceiling; the likely honest result is possible-but-doesn't-pay". THAT PREDICTION WAS WRONG, and this
docstring's first draft asserted it as fact. The selftest assertion written to pin it FIRED, which is the
only reason it was caught -- the negative was written before the measurement existed. Record the sequence,
not just the conclusion: a claim written ahead of its measurement is a claim you will have to retract.

Measured against the HONEST baseline -- CoSaMP, already shipped and wired -- at D=512, N=2048, 8 seeds:

    M      M/D    AMP F1            CoSaMP F1         AMP ms   CoSaMP ms
    16     0.03   1.000 +/- 0.000   1.000 +/- 0.000     21.5         3.3
    64     0.12   1.000 +/- 0.000   1.000 +/- 0.000     21.5        25.4
    86     0.17   1.000 +/- 0.000   1.000 +/- 0.000     21.5        52.6
    128    0.25   0.896 +/- 0.078   0.709 +/- 0.224     22.1       499.7
    171    0.33   0.558 +/- 0.053   0.167 +/- 0.037     20.6       792.4
    200    0.39   0.466 +/- 0.024   0.290 +/- 0.019     21.1      1026.6

So AMP DOES push past the wall where CoSaMP falls apart, with tighter variance, at constant ~21 ms while
CoSaMP's per-round least-squares grows to a full second -- 48x faster at M=200.

THE BASELINE IS NOT A STRAWMAN, checked explicitly before claiming any of this: CoSaMP at 120 iterations
(6.5 SECONDS) still scores 0.154 at M=171 against AMP's 0.559 at 30 iterations. Both have converged; more
iterations help neither. The gap is the algorithm, not the budget.

AND NEITHER METHOD DOMINATES -- the crossover is the real finding:

  * COHERENT DICTIONARIES DESTROY AMP, exactly as the theory says they must (state evolution assumes a
    roughly i.i.d. design matrix). Measured at M=32, D=512, atoms pulled toward 8 shared directions:
        coherence   0.0     0.5     1.0     2.0     4.0
        AMP       1.000   0.052   0.026   0.021   0.026
        CoSaMP    1.000   1.000   1.000   0.562   0.135
        IHT       0.984   0.693   0.411   0.224   0.099
    AMP is the WORST member of the family the moment the dictionary stops being incoherent. CoSaMP remains
    the method there and must not be replaced by this.
  * AMP IS SLOWER AT LIGHT LOAD (21 ms vs CoSaMP's 3 ms at M=16) because its cost is flat in M.
  * AMP DOES NOT NEED K. State evolution sets its own threshold, so it can recover without being told the
    sparsity -- which occlusion, IHT and CoSaMP all require. K-free operation only works at LIGHT load
    (see the alpha note in amp_recall); at heavy load you must supply K.

USE AMP for incoherent dictionaries at heavy load, or when K is unknown and the load is light. USE CoSaMP
for anything coherent, or at light load where it is both exact and cheaper. This is the same shape as the
IHT-versus-occlusion crossover the family already documents: a fifth member, not an upgrade.

A NOTE ON WHY THE DOC'S #1 RANKING IS RIGHT FOR THE WRONG REASON. RESEARCH_CONSOLIDATED.md ranks AMP first
on the strength of beating Bottleneck 2's "20-32 instruction" ceiling. That ceiling was measured with the
LINEAR readout and never existed -- CoSaMP already held exact support to M=86. AMP is worth having anyway,
but for the band M/D 0.25-0.39, which the doc does not mention. Benchmarked against the linear figure it
would have looked like a 5x win; the honest figure is a win over CoSaMP in one regime and a catastrophic
loss in another.

DETERMINISM (per ISA.md)
  No RNG anywhere: the gradient step, the soft threshold, the Onsager term and the final support extraction
  are all deterministic given the cue and codebook. Fixed iteration count. Same inputs, same recovery.
