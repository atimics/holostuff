"""Regression traps for holographic_amp -- the fifth bundle-recovery member.

The headline here is a CROSSOVER, not a win, and the first draft of this module claimed the opposite.
So both directions are pinned: AMP must keep beating CoSaMP at heavy load on incoherent dictionaries,
AND it must keep losing badly on coherent ones. A one-sided assertion is what produced the wrong
docstring in the first place.
